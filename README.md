Face Landmark Detection and Eye Points Extraction using MediaPipe

This project uses the MediaPipe Face Mesh model to detect facial landmarks from images and extract key points around the eyes. The coordinates for the left and right eyes are drawn on the image, visualizing their positions.
Features

    Detect face landmarks using MediaPipe's Face Mesh model.
    Extract eye landmarks (left and right) from detected landmarks.
    Visualize and annotate the eye landmarks on an image using OpenCV.

Dependencies

To run the project, you need to install the following Python libraries:

    mediapipe (for facial landmark detection)
    opencv-python (for image processing and visualization)
    numpy (for numerical operations)
